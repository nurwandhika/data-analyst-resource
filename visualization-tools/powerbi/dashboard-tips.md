# Power BI Dashboard Design Tips

Creating effective dashboards in Power BI involves more than dragging visuals onto a canvas. The following guidelines will help ensure your reports are both informative and easy to use.

## Plan Before You Build

- Start with a clear business question or goal. Know what decisions the dashboard should support.
- Sketch the layout on paper to determine which visuals best represent your metrics.

## Keep It Clean and Simple

- Limit the number of visuals per page to avoid clutter. Use separate pages for different themes (e.g., sales, customer demographics).
- Align visuals neatly and use consistent sizing.
- Avoid unnecessary 3D charts or embellishments that distract from the data.

## Use Appropriate Visuals

- Bar/column charts for comparisons.
- Line charts for trends over time.
- Pie or donut charts only for showing parts of a whole when there are few categories.
- Cards or KPI visuals for highlighting single metrics.

## Leverage Slicers and Filters

- Use slicers to allow users to interactively filter the data (e.g., by date, region, product category).
- Provide clear labels for slicers and filter visuals.

## Apply Consistent Colors and Themes

- Use a limited color palette that aligns with your brand or subject matter.
- Use accent colors to draw attention to key values.

## Optimize Performance

- Avoid importing unnecessary columns or tables into your model.
- Summarize data using aggregated tables when possible.
- Reduce the use of complex DAX measures that calculate across large tables in real time.

## Tell a Story

- Arrange visuals in a logical order that guides the viewer through the narrative.
- Use titles, subtitles, and annotations to highlight insights.

By following these best practices, you can create dashboards that effectively communicate insights and enable informed decision-making.
